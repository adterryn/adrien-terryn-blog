| General topic?               | A mathematical model was used to study how these jellyfish manage to use their neural networks to move around even when injured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Procedure/what was examined? | In several steps, they considered individual nerve cells, networks of nerve cells, the whole animal and the surrounding water. They began by studying an individual nerve cell, then the cell networks, and finally the whole animal. The mathematical model allows them to understand how these cells set the animal in motion and thus answer different hypotheses. These cells can be stimulated by light, and an organ is used to stabilize the jellyfish. Nerve excitation spreads in a wave-like pattern. Their mode of movement is studied in the context of robotics. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | Jellyfish use a neural network to swim in a straight line and to make rotational movements. They can pick up and transmit signals on their bell anytime they are injured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Remaining questions?         | Can we improve underwater robot control with this study? Where does this neural system come from in such a primitive animal?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
