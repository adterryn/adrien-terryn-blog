| General topic?               | Cassiopea or upside-down jellyfish is the cause of irritating water along warm coastal waters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Procedure/what was examined? | Researchers observed the mucus produced by these jellyfish under a microscope and discovered gyratory balls of stinging cells. They named them cassiosomes. Inside these balls are some symbiotic algae. These algae also present in their bodies bring nutrients to the jellyfish through photosynthesis. They also observed that these cassiosomes could kill shrimp and tiny crustaceans. They discovered four other species also possessing. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | These cassiosomes make it possible to supplement the diet of these jellyfish when there is not enough light. And it's these cassiosomes that make the water stinging for divers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Remaining questions?         | Do other species have these cassiosomes?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
