| General topic                | The mechanisms used by jellyfish to regenerate certain parts of their body                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Procedure/what was examined? | the researchers used Cladonema pacificum and studied the spatial pattern of cell proliferation and their roles during the development and regeneration of jellyfish. The researchers used Cladonema pacificum and studied the spatial pattern of cell proliferation and their roles during the development and regeneration of jellyfish. They observed the growth of these jellyfish based on available food or by using a cell cycle inhibiting agent. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | They found that if food was not available, they reduced their size after 24 hours and therefore were able to adapt to environmental conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Remaining questions?         | Is this process the same for stages other than the jellyfish stage?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
