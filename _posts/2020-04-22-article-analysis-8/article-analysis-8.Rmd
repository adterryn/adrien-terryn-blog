| General topic?               | Clytia hemisphaerica, a common jellyfish is being studied to better understand how some externally fertilized animals release their eggs at the right time for fertilization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Procedure/what was examined? | The researchers knew the hormone that activates the process, but they discovered receptors for this previously unknown hormone by studying this jellyfish. To prove that these receptors had a role in egg formation, they mutated them and noticed defects in the development and formation of egg and sperm in both females and males. This discovery will lead to an understanding of how the oocyte becomes an egg. |
| Conclusion/discovery ?       | The hormone receptors that allow the release of eggs at the right time have been discovered and will provide a better understanding of the whole process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Remaining questions?         | What are the links between nutrition and sexual reproduction in animals?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
