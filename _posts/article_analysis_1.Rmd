| General topic?               | The article explains the study of genomes of 3 species of jellyfish. It allows to determine their physical characteristics and their toxicity.                                                       |
| Procedure/what was examined? | They compared the genomes of three jellyfishes and that revealed information about the evolution of cnidarian venom. They found that gene loss and gene duplication play roles in species evolution. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | This study allowed to say that genome sequences are availble in the five classes of cnidarians. The learning of their toxicities will enable the exploration of diverse range of biological traits.  |
| Remaining questions?         | No more really questions but this study will be used to continue the research of specific biological traits.                                                                                         |
