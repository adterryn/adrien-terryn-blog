| General topic?               | A new technology capable of capturing a jellyfish without harming them: an underwater gripper.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Procedure/what was examined? | An underwater gripper with a hydraulic pression to grasp delicately but firmly a jellyfish and  to be able to release it without hurting it. The robotic gripper has been tested on an artificial silicone jellyfish in an aquarium then it was really tested on different kinds of jellies. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | The gripper makes collecting underwater species easier and safer. It prevents injury and stress to the captured  species.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Remaining questions?         | How to improve the device so that it is also effective on open oceans?                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
